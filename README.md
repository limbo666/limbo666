Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a self-taught coding enthusiast who loves to tinker with electronics and craft creative solutions.<br> Coding is my playground, and I primarily enjoy working with:

- **Lua** 🐾
- **VB.NET** 💻
- **C++** 🔧
- **Graphics Design** 🎨

## 🔥 Featured Projects

Here are some of my favorite creations:
